RaytracingWithTheBoys

A C++ ray tracing renderer built from scratch for a class.

Build instructions: Have Visual Studio 2017 installed, and build the solution. 
Unsure if it will build in older versions of Visual Studio. The code does not use any specific MSVC options or system calls, so it theoretically should work with other compilers/OSs, but you will have to fuss with your own build solutions or makefile if you decide to go down that path.

After building, the code will ONLY work in debug mode. I have tried for many hours (and failed) to determine why before deciding that it wasn't worth the time to figure out. Expect it to render slowly as a result.
