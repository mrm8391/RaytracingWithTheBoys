/*
Tone reproduction functionality.

Implemented as static functions, as the world/camera
shouldn't need to "own" a single type of reproduction.
In practice, several different methods can be applied
in a pipeline to postprocess results.

Currently, methods operate on 2D vectors of radiance values
